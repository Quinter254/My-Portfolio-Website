## 1. Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the entire web page content.

## 2. HTML Structure

This HTML file follows a standard structure, starting with the document type declaration and two main sections: `<head>` and `<body>`.

  - **Head Section** (`<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>`): Contains meta-information about the document, including the title.
  - **Body Section** (`<body>`): Contains the content to be displayed in the browser, including headers, paragraphs, lists, and an image.

## 3. Code Explanation

### Head Section

- **Title**: `<title>My Web Page</title>` - Sets the title of the web page displayed on the browser tab.

### Body Section
